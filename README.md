all tests pass, and fixed a glitch which prevented operations from being
used in tandem.

This is a simple Java implementation of the C algorithm in the
pdf paper within this directory.

Use it to read about the elegant C code that inspired this, and the 
java implementation I wrote.

If you'd like, add a bunch of tests. And then submit a pull request.
